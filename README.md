# WindTurbineDataSprint
Data sprint collaboration during DA bootcamp assigned simultaneously with capstone in order to highlight problems that may occur in real work scenarios where you are given multiple high priority projects simultaneously. Students were given the responsibility of assigning tasks, accepting tasks, giving updates, and creating a final presentation.

While all queries were performed using SQL and Python, the final presentation was given through powerpoint with screen captures of visuals created in PowerBI or Tableau for reference.

Trello was used to assign tasks to team members and facilitate real time progress updates.

I learned a lot from this exercise where time management was pivotal to success. 

The only thing I would do differently is to try to create a collaborative report with PowerBI through a Microsoft Fabric workspace now that I know how to set it up as it would have allowed us to skip manually transposing everything into a powerpoint presentation and allowed for interactivity with our data and insights.
